## AutoPlug-Client | What can it do?

server plugins. Then there is some more stuff:

- Automated self updating
- Automated JRE (Java Runtime Enviornment) updating
- Automated server software updating
- Automated, scheduled server restarting
- Automated, modularized backup creation
- Fast, asynchronous, multithreaded task execution
- Have synchronized (shared) folders
- Web-Panel for starting, stopping restarting the server and viewing the last updating results summaries

Premium [AutoPlug-Web](https://autoplug.one) features:

- [Online Console](online-console.gif)
- [Online File-Manager](file-manager.gif)
