## AutoPlug-Client | What can it do?
Well quite a bunch of things actually...
The most outstanding one being (probably), an automated way of updating your server plugins.
Then there is some more stuff:
 - Automated self updating
 - Automated server software updating
 - Automated, scheduled server restarting
 - Automated, modularized backup creation
 - Note that the tasks above are all performed before starting the server (in multiple threads, aka asynchronously)
